There is a world
that is virtual and different.
It can be so cold
make us stand up for what’s right.
Our hope through our life
is if we reset it to the start!
Here we are going far
To save all that we love.
If we give all we've got,
We will make it through.
Here we are like a star
Shining bright on your world...
Today...
Make evil go away!
Code Lyoko, we'll reset it all,
Code Lyoko, be there when you call!
Code Lyoko, we will stand real tall,
Code Lyoko, stronger after all!
A world of machines
it can shadow human nature.
And all that we need
is the way to find the answer.
But one thing is sure
you can count on us for good!
We’ll do our best
to never let you down.
We’re up to the test
to turn this world around!
Here we are going far
to save all that we love.
If we give all we've got,
(Make evil go away!)
Turn your magic on, to me she’d say
Everything you want’s a dream away
Everything you want’s a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds
I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, you make me feel
Like I’m alive again
Said I can’t go on, not in this way
I’m a dream, I die by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me
I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
Cause you make me feel
Like I’m alive again
If we’ve only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
And if we’ve only got this life
You’ll get me through, ohh
And if we’ve only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
Wanna share it with you
With you, with you
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out.
Got my head spinning, no kidding,
I can’t pin you down.
What’s going on in that beautiful mind?
I’m on your magical mystery ride,
And I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me, but I’ll be alright.
My head’s under water,
But I’m breathing fine.
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind.
’Cause all of me
Loves all of you.
Love your curves and all your edges,
All your perfect imperfections.
Give your all to me,
I’ll give my all to you.
You’re my end and my beginning,
’Cause I give you all of me,
And you give me all of you.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you’re crying you’re beautiful too.
The world is beating you down,
You’re my downfall, you’re my muse,
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.
I can’t stop singing,
It’s ringing in my head for you.
My head’s under water,
But I’m breathing fine.
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind.
’Cause all of me
Loves all of you.
Love your curves and all your edges,
All your perfect imperfections.
Give your all to me,
I’ll give my all to you.
You’re my end and my beginning,
Even when I lose I’m winning.
’Cause I give you all of me,
And you give me all of you.
Cards on the table, we’re both showing hearts,
Risking it all, though it’s hard.
’Cause all of me
Loves all of you.
Love your curves and all your edges,
All your perfect imperfections.
Give your all to me,
I’ll give my all to you.
You’re my end and my beginning,
Even when I lose I’m winning.
’Cause I give you all of me,
And you give me all of you.
I give you all of me,
And you give me all of you.
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
They say you've found somebody new,
But that won't stop my loving you.
I just can't let you walk away,
Forget the love I had for you.
Guess I could find somebody, too,
But I don't wan't no one but you.
How could you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?
Before you leave be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine.
'Cause I'll just say we've never met,
If I'm that easy to forget.
I’m forgiven because You were forsaken,
I’m accepted, You were condemned.
I am alive and well, Your sprit is within me,
Because You died and rose again.
Amazing love,
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
I know it’s true.
It’s my joy to honour You,
In all I do, I honour You.
You are my King
Jesus You are my King
Chasin' this American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
In America, America
Just close your eyes and breathe
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen
Every breath I breathe
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace
Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to
What have you done to my heart
As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
You alone are my strength my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship thee
You're my friend and You are my brother,
Even though you are a king.
I love you more than any other,
So much more than anything.
Australians all let us rejoice
For we are young and free
We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
Our home is girt by sea:
Our land abounds in nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare,
In history's page let every stage
Advance Australia fair,
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair.
Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
May sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
Oh hush my dear, it’s been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me darlin’, trust me darlin’
It’s been a loveless year
I’m a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
I’m a bad liar
Now you know
I’m a bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go
Trust me darlin’, trust me darlin’
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don’t want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I’m a bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring
Oh I’ve been asking, for
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don’t want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go
I can’t breathe
I can’t be
I can’t be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time, believe me
Hi-ya, Barbie!
Hi, Ken!
You wanna go for a ride?
Sure, Ken!
Jump in!
I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
You can touch, you can play,
if you say, I'm always yours,
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
Touch me
Take me to that other place
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It was a beautiful day
You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out
Beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea.
A great high Priest whose Name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart.
I know that while in heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart.
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin.
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free.
For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.
My perfect spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
King of glory and of grace,
One in Himself I cannot die.
My soul is purchased by His blood,
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ my Savior and my God!
How soon do we forget, how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game...
Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same
Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're, you're...
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
And no song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
And our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go? And how come it’s so hard?
It’s not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I’ll tell you one thing, it’s always better when we’re together
It’s always better when we’re together
We’ll look at the stars when we’re together
It’s always better when we’re together
And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they’ll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
That they’ll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I’d be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be we’ll sit beneath the mango tree now
It’s always better when we’re together
We’re somewhere in between together
Well it’s always better when we’re together
I believe in memories they look so pretty when I sleep
And when I wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We’re better together
Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head
The people you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
Pretending he just doesn't see?
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever’s gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops
Do you know where the wilds things go
They go along to take your honey
Break down, now weep, build up, breakfast
Now let’s eat, my love, my love love love
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I’ve become so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(Can’t wake up)
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I’ve become
Now that I know what I’m without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(Can’t wake up)
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I’ve become
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I’ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(Can’t wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(Can’t wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I’ve become
(Bring me to life)
I’ve been living a lie, there’s nothing inside
(Bring me to life)
God save our gracious Queen,
Long live our noble Queen,
God save The Queen:
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us:
God save The Queen.
God save The Queen!
1. Days are filled with sorrow and care,
Hearts are lonely and drear.
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Calvary, Calvary;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.
2. Cast your care on Jesus today,
Leave your worry and fear.
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.
3. Troubled soul, the Savior can feel
Every heartache and tear.
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.
Are we gonna have a problem?
You got a bone to pick?
You've come so far
Why now are you pulling on my dick?
I'd normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I'm feeling nice
Here's some advice
Listen up, biatch!
I like!
If you lack the balls
You can go play dolls
Let your mommy fix you a snack
Or you could come smoke
Pound some rum and coke
In my Porsche with the quarterback
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You're not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store
Guys fall
All you
Say goodbye to Shamu
That freak's
If she
She would leave you to rot
Woah!
Let's go tear up someone's lawn
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove
You're not a pussy anymore
Then step into my candy store
You can join the team
You can live the dream
You can fly with eagles
Or if you prefer
Keep on testing me
And end up like her!
Shut up Heather!
Step into my candy store!
Then step into my candy store!
It's my candy store
It's my candy!
It's my candy store
It's my candy!
It's my candy store
It's my candy store!
Woah!
Woah! Woah! Woah!
At your feet
Help you cheat
Not your friend
I can tell in the end
'Course if you don't care
Fine! Go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on
Or forget the creep
Woah! Woah! Woah!
Or you can bitch and moan
Or you can die alone
Woah!
Time for you to prove
You're not a lame ass anymore!
Pay the check
Have to do
Had your shot
And get in my jeep
I like!
Honey, whatchu waiting fo...
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better
Than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better
Than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better
Than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Throw em back, till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
On for tonight
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Throw em back till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
I wish I was special
What the hell am I doing here?
She's running
She runs, runs, runs, runs
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
We get it almost every night
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It is such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life;
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.
Friday night and the lights are low.
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing,
You come in to look for a king.
Anybody could be that guy.
Night is young and the music's high.
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine.
You're in the mood for a dance,
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen,
Feel the beat from the tambourine.
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life,
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.
Dig in the dancing queen...
You're a teaser, you turn'em on,
Leave them burning and then you're gone,
Looking out for another, anyone will do.
