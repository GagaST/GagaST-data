Weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for paths left alone
'cause beyond every bend
Is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
Give up your heart left broken
and let that mistake pass on
'cause the love that you lost
wasn't worth what it cost
and in time you'll be glad its gone
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
may your love never end
and If you need a friend
there's a seat here along side me...
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all, it all
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you
Oh oh oh oh say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something...
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
How do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
How do you measure a year in the life?
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
remember a year in the life of friends
Remember the love
Remember the love
Remember the love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that was the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you
Even now that we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you're here forever
You and me together
Nothing gets better
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You
Shout to the Lord
All the Earth, let us sing
Power and majesty
Praise to the King
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Helpless to the bass and faded light
Oh we were born to get together,
Born to get together
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
She took my arm,
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm,
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back,
She said shut up and dance with me!
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance!
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream
I knew we were born to be together,
Deep in her eyes,
I think I see the future
We were victims of the night,
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
You wait, little girl, on an empty stage
For fate to turn the light on
Your life, little girl, is an empty page
That men will want to write on
To write on
You are sixteen going on seventeen
Baby, it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful
Baby, you're on the brink
You are sixteen going on seventeen
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and rogues and cads
Will offer you food and wine
Totally unprepared are you
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you
Of things beyond your ken
You need someone older and wiser
Telling you what to do
I am seventeen going on eighteen
I'll take care of you
I am sixteen going on seventeen
I know that I'm naive
Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet
And willingly I believe
I am sixteen going on seventeen
Innocent as a rose
Bachelor dandies, drinkers of brandies
What do I know of those
Totally unprepared am I
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared am I
Of things beyond my ken
I need someone older and wiser
Telling me what to do
You are seventeen going on eighteen
I'll depend on you
I don't wanna be the girl who has to fill the silence...
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Aahh, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly, "come and play"
Aahh, I am falling
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
But how do I feel this good sober?
I'm comin' down
Comin' down
Comin' down
Spinnin' round
Spinnin' round
Spinnin' round
Looking for myself.. Sober
When it's good, then it's good, it's so good, 'till it goes bad
Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry
Never again
Broken down in agony
And just trying to find a friend
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
But how do I feel this good sober?
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past
There must have been a moment of truth
For here you are, standing there, loving me
Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete
O simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
O simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
O simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
So why don't we go
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know
Speak softly, love,
and hold me warm against your heart.
I feel your words;
the tender trembling moments start.
We’re in a world, our very own,
sharing a love that only few have ever known.
Wine-colored days warmed by the sun,
deep velvet nights when we are one.
Speak softly, love,
so no one hears us but the sky.
The vows of love we make
will live until we die.
My life is yours, and all because
you came into my world with love, so softly, love.
Speak softly, love,
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirts, no blouse
Just us, you find out
For you here
And now
So let me hold
These hearts adore
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
Just us, you find out
No no
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Use the sleeves on my sweater
Lets have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centred
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts
No shirts, no blouse
It's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
I hate the beach
But I stand in california with my toes in the sand
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven.
Time can bring you down,
Time can bend your knees.
Time can break your heart,
Have you begging please, begging please.
Beyond the door,
There's peace I'm sure,
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven.
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven.
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way
Through night and day,
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven.
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sins she’s paid for
A lone speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There’s nothing wrong with just a taste of what you’ve paid for
Say what you mean, tell me I’m right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
Woah, Mona Lisa
You’re guaranteed to run this town
Woah, Mona Lisa
I’d pay to see you frown
He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she’d have nothing left to sell him
Say what you mean, tell me I’m right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
Woah, Mona Lisa
You’re guaranteed to run this town
Woah, Mona Lisa
I’d pay to see you frown
Mona Lisa
Pleased to please ya
Say what you mean, tell me I’m right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
Against the waves with our swords in our hands
Against the sea with our backs to the walls
Against distress in the presence of our enemies
Against the storms roaring at our faces
A cry rang out throughout the skies
A beckon, the flight of the cranes
The call of the alps
The tune in our hearts
Tomorrow is uncertain
Who knows what it will bring?
But one thing is for sure, love
With you, I have everything
We can overcome them all
If we all stand strong together
There's no way we can fall
There's no storm we can't outrun
We will always find the sun
Leave the past and all its scars
A happy beginning now is ours
If we're facing endless night
Take my hand and join the fight
Past the clouds we'll find the stars
A happy beginning now is ours
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
There's no storm we can't outrun
We will always find the sun
Leave the past and all its scars
A happy beginning now is ours
Past the clouds we'll find the stars (Oh, we'll find)
A happy beginning now is ours!
